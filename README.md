Hey guys,
Let us assume that, you have a Bakery store and that store is very famous. And you cannot manage the visits of customers in your store with pen and paper. To as a Python Expert, by using a Pandas and openpyxl.
In this Bakery management system, you can easily store or access data like name of customer, item name, quantity and date of item or if you want to delete it, it can also be imported automatically in a separate sheet..
